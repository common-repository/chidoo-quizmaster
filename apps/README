Creating custom apps
====================

1. A chidoo quizmaster app must derive from ChiQmApp.

2. All standard chiqm apps reside within the plugin's app subfolder.
   Custom apps can reside anywhere accessible by your wp installation.
   You need to define the custom app directory in the quizmaster backend.
   Note that the custom app folder must be named `apps`.

3. Necessary minimum minimum file structure:

App folder and class file name must be named after the app slug. 
It's a good advice to choose an individual app slug name:

Slug: my-app

(DIR)  my-app/
(DIR)  my-app/css
(FILE) my-app/css/my-app.css
(DIR)  my-app/js
(FILE) my-app/js/my-app.js
(FILE) my-app/my-app.php
(FILE) my-app/index.php // should be empty ...

Example contents of my-app/my-app.php:
---

require_once( CHIQM_PLUGIN_PATH.'includes/class-chiqm-app.php');

class MyApp extends ChiQmApp
{
  public function __construct() {
    /* necessary fields */
    $this->slug = "my-app";
    $this->name = "My Fancy Application";
    $this->version = '0.0.1';
    $this->author = 'Your Name <your-email@your-domain.com>';
    $this->description = 'This is a super-fancy application.';
   
		$this->setShortcodeName('my_app_shortcode');
    $this->setShortcodeHandler('my_app_shortcode_handler');
  }

  public function my_app_shortcode_handler($atts){
    return "Hi from ".$this->getName().", I'm shortcode " . 
		  $this->getShortcodeName()." performing " . 
			$this->getShortcodeHandler().".";
  }
}

Have a look at ChiQmApp::register_ajax_callbacks in 
`/chidoo-quizmaster/includes/class-chiqm-app.php`
how to register individual ajax callbacks for your app.

Also, have a look at the available apps how to handle l10n, JavaScript, CSS
and Ajax requests from within a single app.

Q: Why activation an deactivation of single apps?

A: An app and all its files and assets are only loaded if a) its shordcode is
placed on a page AND b) if it is in activated state which is an advantage if 
there were multiple apps available.
